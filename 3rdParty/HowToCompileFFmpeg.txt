Step 1)
Download the MinGW Installation Manager and install all packages in Basic Setup
Nota: O compilador gcc dever ser >= 3.4.5
Add c:\MinGW\bin on you PATH

Download yasm-1.2.0-win32 and put it in C:\yasm\ 
(yasm-1.2.0-win64.exe for 64 bits)

Step 2)
Open up visual studio 2012 developer console
( under Start>All Programs> VS12> VS Tools> Developer command prompt for VS12 ) and Navigate to 
c:\MinGW\msys\1.0>

Step 3)
Run msys.bat from here.

Step 4)
Change your current home directory to ffmpeg ie "cd $(ProjectRoot)/3rdParty/FFmpeg"
f.ex: "cd c:/dev/SiaPlayerDemo/3rdParty/FFmpeg"
Where ProjectRoot is where the project has been copied to.

Step 5) 
Rename mingw link.exe to avoid conflict with MS link.exe with "mv /bin/link.exe /bin/mingw_link.exe". Now running link.exe should point at MS link.
Double check with the command "which link" it should respond something like "/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0/VC/Bin/link.exe"

Step 6) 
Extend default path with the command "export PATH=$PATH:$(ProjectRoot)/3rdParty/FFmpeg"
f.ex: "export PATH=$PATH:c:/dev/SiaPlayerDemo/3rdParty/FFmpeg"
Check the result, with the command "echo $PATH". It should report all Visual Studio's paths, plus c:\ffmpeg

Step 7)
type the commands below. (a) and (b) take some time to complete (about 5-10 minutes)
a) "./configure --prefix=ffmpeg/ --enable-shared --extra-cflags=-I/c/MinGW/include --yasmexe='C:/yasm/yasm-1.2.0-win32.exe' --enable-gpl --cpu=i686" ... or ...
a) "./configure --prefix=ffmpeg/ --enable-shared --extra-cflags=-I/c/MinGW/include --yasmexe='C:/yasm/yasm-1.2.0-win64.exe' --enable-gpl --cpu=x86_64" for 64bits
b) "make"
c) "make install"

Step 8) Now under "C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg\lib" you should see some *.def and *.a files. Its time to convert *.a to standard MS *.lib files.
Change directory using the command "cd .\ffmpeg\lib"
Take a file list with "ls -l" command.
For every *.a file you see, use the following command 
lib /machine:i386 /def:avcodec-55.def /out:avcodec.lib
lib /machine:i386 /def:avformat-55.def /out:avformat.lib
lib /machine:i386 /def:avutil-52.def /out:avutil.lib
lib /machine:i386 /def:swscale-2.def /out:swscale.lib

Step 8)

You are ready. Just include your *.lib libraries in the linker input and Additional Dependecies option, and add your project includes, to the msinttypes (inttypes.h & stdint.h) you downloaded from the 1st step.
You may also set References to No (/OPT:NOREF) under the linker optimization settings, project properties>linker>optimization>References to No (/OPT:NOREF)
